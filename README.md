This program simulates a movie ticket booking system. It allows users to view movie listings, select seats, make bookings,
and calculate the total cost. It also considers seat availability and seat selection validation.

The program first declares two classes, `Movie` and `BookingSystem`. The `Movie` class stores information about a movie, such as its title, price, and number of seats available. The `BookingSystem` class stores a list of movies and provides methods for viewing the movie listings, booking tickets, and calculating the total cost.

The program then defines the main function. The main function first creates an instance of the `BookingSystem` class. It then calls the `showMovieList()` method to display the movie listings. The user can then select a movie and enter the number of seats they want to book. The program then calls the `bookTickets()` method to book the tickets. The `bookTickets()` method first checks if the number of seats are available. If they are, the method books the tickets and displays the total cost. Otherwise, the method displays an error message.

The program finally calls the `exit()` function to terminate.
